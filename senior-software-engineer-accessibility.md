# Senior Software Engineer - Accessibility

### Why do you want to work at GitHub?

I want to work at Github if:

* My product ideas are valued as much as my technical contributions
* I am encouraged to engage in new roles, develop new skills and step outside my comfort zone
* Collaboration is rewarded and innovation is encouraged
* Github supports a positive, empathetic and stable work environment

### Why do you feel you would be a fit for this role?

I enjoy refactoring code that enables developer productivity through clarity and reusability.

I have ~6 months experience building and testing against WCAG guidelines and it's important that the community continues to expand the standard.

I'd like to continue working with the "view\_component" gem and help expand the Primer system, because Rails should provide robust, accessible and testable front end solutions by default.

I'd like to gain experience building progressive web applications.

I'm not shy about asking questions or highlighting my knowledge gaps.

Formally educated in architecture and design, I enjoy building beautiful and functional spaces.

### What do you think are some of the challenges of working remotely, and how would you address them?

At the team level, feelings of isolation or disconnectedness can adversely affect collaboration. 

Perhaps a new team member doesn't want to bother their new co-workers, even though they have been stuck on a problem for a few days.

Or maybe an existing team member is so intensely focused, they miss opportunities to connect with the rest of the team.

In either case it's important that teams check-in with each other daily - it can be about progress, or a simple "how are you doing today?"; simple gestures go a long way towards feeling included and keeping morale high.

In general, timely responses help everyone feel like they aren't sending slacks into the void and encourage them to reach out frequently.

As an aside, keeping zoom calls short but with cameras enabled can help maintain engagement amongst the group; you're talking to real life people!
